    In the second part of the tutorial we want to create the form to add new books to the library. We also need 
    some mechanism to create new authors. In order to achieve all this, we need to utilize different form elements,
    that android provides and tweak them a little bit, to do exactly what we want. 
    
    <h2><a href="#form" name="form">Creating the form</a></h2>
    First of all we need the layout for the form itself. So what do we want to achieve? We want to enter the name of the book. 
    Also the authors should be selectable from a list of all authors, that we know. And last but not least, we also need to buttons.
    One to show a dialog to create a new author and one to save the book to the database. 

    Entering text is easy. Android provides a class called <pre>EditText</pre>, that will do exactly, what we need. 
    We can also create the item for the authors pretty easy, by using the <pre>Spinner</pre> class. All the other stuff in the
    following layout file is basically getting the items to their correct position. We use a <pre>TableLayout</pre>
    so that we can display a label in front of each editor and a <pre>LinearLayout</pre> to place a button at
    the bottom of the form. 
    
    <pre class="brush: xml">{% include "documentation/examples/tutorial_add_book.xml" %}</pre>
