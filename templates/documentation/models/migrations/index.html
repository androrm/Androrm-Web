                    In every project change happens. Old models need to be updated and new ones need to be added. The latter is not much of a  problem, as androrm simply recognizes your new models and creates new tables for them. The same does not hold, if you add fields to your existing models. To save time, androrm won't check each time if something has changed on your models and perform the respective updates. In the past that meant you needed to manually drop the table and have it recreated by androrm. We all knew that this is not particularly good. To overcome this issue, we introduce <em>migrations</em>. This page will teach you how to update your model classes with ease.
