    Adding androrm to your project is as simple as 1, 2, 3. The only descission, you have to make right
    from the start is, whether you want to go with <a href="{% url download_latest %}">the latest stable release</a>
    or if you want to check out the <a href="#">latest version in the repository</a>.
    
    <br /><br />
    
    Now, after you have decided for one version, the steps are exactly the same. Assuming you work within 
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">eclipse</a> to write your android application, first 
    create a new folder called <pre>lib</pre>. Right-click your project and choose <pre>New > Folder</pre>. 
    
    <br /><br />
    <img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/new-folder.jpg" />
    <br /><br />
    
    After that, just copy and paste the <pre>androrm.jar</pre> file into this folder and add it to the <pre>build path</pre>. 
    You simply do this, by right-clicking the <pre>jar</pre> and selecting <pre>Build Path > Add to Build Path</pre>.
    
    <br /><br />
    <img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/build-path.jpg" />
    <br /><br />
    
    <b>That's it!</b> You're done and can now start <a href="{% url documentation_models %}">defining your models</a>.
    
    <hr />
    
    <h2><a href="#dependencies" name="dependencies">Dependencies</a></h2>
    
    Androrm uses the following third-party libraries in order to provide its functionality: 
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://commons.apache.org/lang/">Apache Commons - Lang</a> (3.1)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h2><a href="#models" name="models">Registering your models</a></h2>
    After you added the library to your classpath you still have to tell androrm which classes, it should manage. 
    Unfortunately you can't just hand in a package name at this stage. But this support should come in future 
    releases. For now, there are two steps you have to take. 
    
    <h3>1. Choose a name for your database</h3>
    By default androrm will create a database called <pre>my_database</pre>. If you want to change that name
    for any reason (this might be handy if you create test databases), you can easily do so.
    
    <pre class="brush: java">{% include "documentation/examples/installation/database_name.java" %}</pre>
    
    <h3>2. Register your models</h3>
    The second and also the last step is to tell androrm exactly which classes you want to have managed. You only
    have to do this once, preferably in your launcher activity. 
    
    <pre class="brush: java">{% include "documentation/examples/installation/models.java" %}</pre>
    
    After these two steps, you are set up and ready to go!
    
    <hr />
    
    <h3>Post installation</h3>
    
    Now, that you have installed androrm, you may want to have a look at <a href="{% url documentation_models %}">how
    to define models</a>. Or, if you aren't too sure about your skills, first of <a href="{% url documentation_tutorials %}">take a look at the
    tutorial</a>.
