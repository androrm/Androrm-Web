        <p>
            You think androrm is a cool tool and you also have lots of ideas on how to improve it? If yes, then this is <strong>your</strong> section! Go ahead and fork the project on github and maybe become part of the core development team. 
        </p>
        
        <p>        
            Or did you find a defect or something you want to have improved? Then <a href="https://github.com/androrm/androrm/issues">file a bug</a> or <a href="https://github.com/androrm/androrm/issues">a feature request</a> and help finding the parts, we forgot to cover!
        </p>

            If you've been here before, you might notice, that we don't longer use phabricator. Back then it seemed like a good idea but it turned out, that most people didn't get it. This is a huge problem, if you as a developer want to get feedback. So now, if you want to add a feature request or report a bug, please use <a href="https://github.com/androrm/androrm/issues">GitHub issues</a>. This is also where the code is, so tracking is much easier.

            THANK YOU!
